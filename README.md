This Repository shows how to implement IoT Push notifications. Using IoT push notifications, we can send notifications to other devices. In this case, we want to send an IoT push notifications from a smart object (Arduino Node MCU) to a mobile smartphone (i.e. Android smartphone). This project integrates different eco-systems: IoT and Android. This project can have several implementations: for example, we can send a push notification to our smartphone when an alert occurs.
